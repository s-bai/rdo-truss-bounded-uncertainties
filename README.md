# Robust design optimization of truss structures with bounded uncertainties

Thank you for your interest in this project!

This repo contains part of the codes for the current research by Song Bai and Zhan Kang from Dept. of Engineering Mechanics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.

Please read the notes below for additional pre-requisites for the implementation of the codes.

## Research paper

The [research paper](./On-robust-design-optimization-of-truss-structures-with-bounded-uncertainties.pdf) published on Structural Multidisciplinary Optimization of the present study is provided in the repo.

The GCMMA optimizer for the current research ought to be obtained by contacting Prof. Svanberg.

P.S. The codes for the present study were written when the author was a beginner Ph.D. student, thus a lot of improvements can be made to the codes for better performance as well as readability. However, the author has cultivated good coding habits during the doctoral research. Please refer to the repo titled "Robust topology optimization for structures under bounded random loads and material uncertainties" for checking out the latest coding style and ability of the author (Song Bai).
